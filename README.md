## Project Description

The "Little Lemon App" is a user interface design project created as part of the **Create the User Interface with SwiftUI** course. It demonstrates the skills and techniques learned during the course in building intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces using SwiftUI.

## Figma Design

For the design of the app, we utilized [Figma] (https://www.figma.com/file/Tdcru4a46gHCn2CibvNe5W/Project-Little-Lemon?type=design&node-id=148-7&mode=design&t=0beRXHKylMrBzGD3-0) as a collaborative design tool. The Figma design provides a detailed visual representation of the app's user interface, including layouts, color schemes, typography, and more.
